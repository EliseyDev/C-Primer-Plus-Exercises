/*
  Write a program that uses one printf() call to print your first name and last name on
  one line, uses a second printf() call to print your first and last names on two separate
  lines, and uses a pair of printf() calls to print your first and last names on one line.
  The output should look like this (but using your name):
  Gustav Mahler <- First print statement
  Gustav        <- Second print statement
  Mahler        <- Still the second print statement
  Gustav Mahler <- Third and fourth print statements
